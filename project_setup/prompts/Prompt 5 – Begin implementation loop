# --- BUILD STEP 1 ---
Continue in the exact order laid out in PLANNING.md:

1. Announce the current Linear issue (# & title).
2. Summarise what code you’ll write or refactor.
3. Execute code changes using Write-mode.
4. Run unit tests; if green, move the Linear issue to “In Review”.
5. Document decisions in /docs/CHANGELOG.md (append).
6. Ask me for review or to continue.

Repeat for each subsequent task.
