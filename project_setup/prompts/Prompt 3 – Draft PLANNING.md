# --- PLAN AUTHORING ---
Using BACKLOG + DESIGN_CONTEXT, create /PLANNING.md with:

1. **Purpose & Success Criteria** – 1-2 paragraphs.
2. **Assumptions** – bullets (auth, rate-limits, data mapping rules).
3. **Task Execution Order** – numbered list of Linear issue IDs in the sequence we’ll tackle them; nest sub-tasks where helpful.
4. **New Tasks Needed** – any missing API scaffolding, env-var setup, testing harnesses, deploy scripts.
5. **Risks & Mitigations** – table with risk, impact, owner, mitigation.
6. **Definition of Done** – explicit exit criteria.

Commit the file and post a preview in chat.
