# --- TASK HYGIENE ---
For every “New Task Needed” in PLANNING.md:

🔌 use linear mcp
• If a matching issue already exists (title fuzzy-match ≥ 0.8), update it with the new description & link to PLANNING.md.
• Else, create a new issue under the same project, add appropriate labels & estimates, and link back.

Print a table `[issue# | action | url]`.
