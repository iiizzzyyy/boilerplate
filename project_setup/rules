# üè• Oro HubSpot-Dr.Crono Integration - Project Rules

## üîê Healthcare Compliance & Security

- **HIPAA Compliance Framework**:
  - All patient data handling must include audit trails and encryption
  - Implement role-based access controls for sensitive medical information
  - Document data flow and storage patterns for compliance reviews
  - Ensure all API communications use TLS 1.2+ encryption

- **Patient Data Privacy**:
  - Separate marketing communications from transactional medical communications
  - Implement opt-out handling that preserves critical medical notifications
  - Store consent forms with verifiable e-signature integration (DocuSign + HubSpot)
  - Maintain data retention policies aligned with medical record requirements

## üîå External System Integration

- **HubSpot Integration Guidelines**:
  - Use HubSpot MCP for API documentation and endpoint management
  - Implement webhook validation for form submissions and patient updates
  - Distinguish between marketing and transactional email workflows
  - Create custom properties for medical workflow stages

- **Dr. Crono API Management**:
  - Account for API maturity limitations (1-year-old API)
  - Implement robust error handling for limited functionality areas
  - Design fallback manual processes during API unavailability
  - Monitor API rate limits and implement appropriate throttling

- **AWS Serverless Architecture**:
  - Use Lambda functions for event-driven patient data processing
  - Implement EventBridge for cross-system workflow orchestration
  - Design API Gateway with proper authentication and rate limiting
  - Include dead letter queues for failed patient data synchronization

## üìã Medical Workflow Automation

- **Patient Journey Tracking**:
  - Map patient stages: Lead ‚Üí Consent ‚Üí Scheduling ‚Üí Treatment ‚Üí Follow-up
  - Implement real-time status synchronization between systems
  - Create automated reminder workflows for incomplete onboarding steps
  - Track consent form completion with compliance timestamps

- **Data Synchronization Rules**:
  - Sync patient profiles within 30-minute intervals (excluding credit card data)
  - Validate critical fields (DOB, contact info) with consistent formatting
  - Flag and resolve duplicate patient records across systems
  - Maintain data integrity during manual-to-automated workflow transitions

## üß™ Healthcare-Specific Testing

- **Integration Testing Focus**:
  - Validate patient data flow accuracy between HubSpot and Dr. Crono
  - Test consent form capture and e-signature workflow completion
  - Verify appointment scheduling automation and conflict resolution
  - Validate HIPAA compliance in data transmission and storage

- **User Acceptance Testing**:
  - Test medical staff workflows for patient onboarding efficiency
  - Validate patient experience through form submission and scheduling
  - Test marketing vs. transactional email differentiation
  - Verify compliance officer access to audit trails and reports

## üìä Medical Practice Reporting

- **Dashboard Requirements**:
  - Patient journey pipeline from lead to treatment completion
  - Consent form completion rates and compliance tracking
  - Appointment booking trends and no-show analytics
  - Revenue tracking from patient conversions

- **Compliance Reporting**:
  - Audit trail documentation for patient data access
  - Consent form completion and e-signature verification
  - Communication opt-out status and transactional email delivery
  - Data retention and deletion compliance reports

## üöÄ Deployment & Go-Live Strategy

- **Phased Implementation**:
  - Phase 1: Core data synchronization (Weeks 1-5)
  - Phase 2: Automated workflows and communication (Weeks 6-7)
  - Phase 3: Reporting and compliance features (Weeks 8-9)
  - Phase 4: Production deployment and monitoring (Week 10)

- **Rollback Planning**:
  - Maintain manual workflow capabilities during transition
  - Implement feature flags for gradual automation enablement
  - Create data backup procedures for patient information
  - Document rollback procedures for each integration component

## üìö Documentation & Training

- **Medical Staff Training Materials**:
  - Patient onboarding workflow changes and new automation
  - Consent form management and e-signature processes
  - Dashboard usage for patient pipeline monitoring
  - Escalation procedures for integration failures

- **Compliance Documentation**:
  - Data flow diagrams for audit purposes
  - Privacy impact assessments for patient data handling
  - API security configuration and access control documentation
  - Incident response procedures for data breaches or system failures

## üîÑ Maintenance & Support

- **Ongoing Monitoring**:
  - Patient data synchronization accuracy and timing
  - API performance and error rates for HubSpot and Dr. Crono
  - Consent form completion rates and e-signature failures
  - Medical workflow automation success metrics

- **Version Management**:
  - Track Dr. Crono API updates and compatibility requirements
  - Monitor HubSpot feature changes affecting medical workflows
  - Plan for AWS service updates and serverless function maintenance
  - Document integration changes for compliance audit trails

## üìã Linear Task Management - Medical Integration Focus

- **Task Categories**:
  - **HIPAA**: Compliance and security implementation tasks
  - **Integration**: HubSpot-Dr.Crono data flow and API tasks
  - **Workflow**: Patient journey automation and business process tasks
  - **Testing**: Medical workflow validation and compliance testing tasks

- **Medical Workflow Task Templates**:
  ```markdown
  ## Patient Data Sync Task
  - Medical workflow impact: [How this affects patient care]
  - Compliance requirements: [HIPAA/regulatory considerations]
  - Integration dependencies: [HubSpot/Dr.Crono API requirements]
  - Testing criteria: [Medical staff validation needs]
  - Rollback plan: [Manual process fallback]
  ```
